## 🎓 KEY LEARNINGS

### **What Worked Well:**
1. ✅ **GPU Acceleration:** PyTorch CUDA 11.8 made training 10-20x faster
2. ✅ **Strong Augmentation:** Mosaic (0.8) + Mixup (0.15) improved generalization
3. ✅ **YOLOv8s Balance:** Perfect trade-off between accuracy and speed
4. ✅ **Early Planning:** Having documentation templates saved time
5. ✅ **Bug Fixes:** Addressing RGBA format issue improved app robustness

### **Challenges Overcome:**
1. ⚡ **GPU Setup Crisis:** Fixed PyTorch CPU-only installation in time
2. 💾 **Memory Management:** Overnight training crashed, but 50-epoch model sufficient
3. 🖼️ **Format Compatibility:** Added automatic RGBA→RGB conversion for Google images
4. ⏰ **Time Pressure:** 13-hour deadline required strategic prioritization

### **If You Did It Again:**
1. 🔧 Test GPU setup at the very beginning
2. 📝 Start documentation alongside development
3. 🧪 Test app with diverse image sources earlier
4. 💡 Consider batch size reduction for memory constraints
5. 📊 Generate more training visualizations (F1, PR curves)
